	"description": "Retrieves the specified inline policy document that is embedded with the specified IAM role.  Policies returned by this API are URL-encoded compliant with RFC 3986. You can use a URL decoding method to convert the policy back to plain JSON text. For example, if you use Java, you can use the decode method of the java.net.URLDecoder utility class in the Java SDK. Other languages and SDKs provide similar functionality.  An IAM role can also have managed policies attached to it. To retrieve a managed policy document that is attached to a role, use GetPolicy to determine the policy's default version, then use GetPolicyVersion to retrieve the policy document. For more information about policies, see Managed Policies and Inline Policies in the IAM User Guide. For more information about roles, see Using Roles to Delegate Permissions and Federate Identities.",
