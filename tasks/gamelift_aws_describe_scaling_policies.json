	"description": "Retrieves all scaling policies applied to a fleet. To get a fleet's scaling policies, specify the fleet ID. You can filter this request by policy status, such as to retrieve only active scaling policies. Use the pagination parameters to retrieve results as a set of sequential pages. If successful, set of ScalingPolicy objects is returned for the fleet. A fleet may have all of its scaling policies suspended (StopFleetActions). This action does not affect the status of the scaling policies, which remains ACTIVE. To see whether a fleet's scaling policies are in force or suspended, call DescribeFleetAttributes and check the stopped actions. Operations related to fleet capacity scaling include:    DescribeFleetCapacity     UpdateFleetCapacity     DescribeEC2InstanceLimits    Manage scaling policies:    PutScalingPolicy (auto-scaling)    DescribeScalingPolicies (auto-scaling)    DeleteScalingPolicy (auto-scaling)     Manage fleet actions:    StartFleetActions     StopFleetActions     ",
