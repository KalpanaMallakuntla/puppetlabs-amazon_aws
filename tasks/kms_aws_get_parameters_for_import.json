	"description": "Returns the items you need in order to import key material into AWS KMS from your existing key management infrastructure. For more information about importing key material into AWS KMS, see Importing Key Material in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide. You must specify the key ID of the customer master key (CMK) into which you will import key material. This CMK's Origin must be EXTERNAL. You must also specify the wrapping algorithm and type of wrapping key (public key) that you will use to encrypt the key material. You cannot perform this operation on a CMK in a different AWS account. This operation returns a public key and an import token. Use the public key to encrypt the key material. Store the import token to send with a subsequent ImportKeyMaterial request. The public key and import token from the same response must be used together. These items are valid for 24 hours. When they expire, they cannot be used for a subsequent ImportKeyMaterial request. To get new ones, send another GetParametersForImport request. The result of this operation varies with the key state of the CMK. For details, see How Key State Affects Use of a Customer Master Key in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.",
