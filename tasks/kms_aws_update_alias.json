{
	"description": "Associates an existing alias with a different customer master key (CMK). Each CMK can have multiple aliases, but the aliases must be unique within the account and region. You cannot perform this operation on an alias in a different AWS account. This operation works only on existing aliases. To change the alias of a CMK to a new value, use CreateAlias to create a new alias and DeleteAlias to delete the old alias. Because an alias is not a property of a CMK, you can create, update, and delete the aliases of a CMK without affecting the CMK. Also, aliases do not appear in the response from the DescribeKey operation. To get the aliases of all CMKs in the account, use the ListAliases operation.  An alias name can contain only alphanumeric characters, forward slashes (/), underscores (_), and dashes (-). An alias must start with the word alias followed by a forward slash (alias/). The alias name can contain only alphanumeric characters, forward slashes (/), underscores (_), and dashes (-). Alias names cannot begin with aws; that alias name prefix is reserved by Amazon Web Services (AWS). The result of this operation varies with the key state of the CMK. For details, see How Key State Affects Use of a Customer Master Key in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.",
