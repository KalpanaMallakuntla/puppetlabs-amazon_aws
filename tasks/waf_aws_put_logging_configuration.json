You can access information about all traffic that AWS WAF inspects using the following steps:   Create an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose .  Create the data firehose with a PUT source and in the region that you are operating. However, if you are capturing logs for Amazon CloudFront, always create the firehose in US East (N. Virginia).    Associate that firehose to your web ACL using a PutLoggingConfiguration request.   When you successfully enable logging using a PutLoggingConfiguration request, AWS WAF will create a service linked role with the necessary permissions to write logs to the Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose. For more information, see Logging Web ACL Traffic Information in the AWS WAF Developer Guide.",
