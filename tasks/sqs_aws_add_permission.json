	"description": "Adds a permission to a queue for a specific principal. This allows sharing access to the queue. When you create a queue, you have full control access rights for the queue. Only you, the owner of the queue, can grant or deny permissions to the queue. For more information about these permissions, see Allow Developers to Write Messages to a Shared Queue in the Amazon Simple Queue Service Developer Guide.   AddPermission writes an Amazon-SQS-generated policy. If you want to write your own policy, use  SetQueueAttributes  to upload your policy. For more information about writing your own policy, see Using Custom Policies with the Amazon SQS Access Policy Language in the Amazon Simple Queue Service Developer Guide. An Amazon SQS policy can have a maximum of 7 actions.  Some actions take lists of parameters. These lists are specified using the param.n notation. Values of n are integers starting from 1. For example, a parameter list with two elements looks like this:  &amp;Attribute.1=first   &amp;Attribute.2=second   Cross-account permissions don't apply to this action. For more information, see see Grant Cross-Account Permissions to a Role and a User Name in the Amazon Simple Queue Service Developer Guide. ",
