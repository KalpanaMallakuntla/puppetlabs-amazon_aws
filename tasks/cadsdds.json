	"description": "Returns information about a stack drift detection operation. A stack drift detection operation detects whether a stack's actual configuration differs, or has drifted, from it's expected configuration, as defined in the stack template and any values specified as template parameters. A stack is considered to have drifted if one or more of its resources have drifted. For more information on stack and resource drift, see Detecting Unregulated Configuration Changes to Stacks and Resources. Use DetectStackDrift to initiate a stack drift detection operation. DetectStackDrift returns a StackDriftDetectionId you can use to monitor the progress of the operation using DescribeStackDriftDetectionStatus. Once the drift detection operation has completed, use DescribeStackResourceDrifts to return drift information about the stack and its resources.",
