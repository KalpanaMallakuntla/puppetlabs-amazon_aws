Includes information about the last time a sync attempted to start, the last sync status, and the last time a sync successfully completed. The number of sync configurations might be too large to return using a single call to ListResourceDataSync. You can limit the number of sync configurations returned by using the MaxResults parameter. To determine whether there are more sync configurations to list, check the value of NextToken in the output. If there are more sync configurations to list, you can request them by specifying the NextToken returned in the call to the parameter of a subsequent call. ",
