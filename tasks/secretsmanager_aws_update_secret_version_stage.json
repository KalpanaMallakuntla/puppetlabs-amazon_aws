	"description": "Modifies the staging labels attached to a version of a secret. Staging labels are used to track a version as it progresses through the secret rotation process. You can attach a staging label to only one version of a secret at a time. If a staging label to be added is already attached to another version, then it is moved--removed from the other version first and then attached to this one. For more information about staging labels, see Staging Labels in the AWS Secrets Manager User Guide.  The staging labels that you specify in the VersionStage parameter are added to the existing list of staging labels--they don't replace it. You can move the AWSCURRENT staging label to this version by including it in this call.  Whenever you move AWSCURRENT, Secrets Manager automatically moves the label AWSPREVIOUS to the version that AWSCURRENT was removed from.  If this action results in the last label being removed from a version, then the version is considered to be 'deprecated' and can be deleted by Secrets Manager.  Minimum permissions  To run this command, you must have the following permissions:   secretsmanager:UpdateSecretVersionStage    Related operations    To get the list of staging labels that are currently associated with a version of a secret, use  DescribeSecret  and examine the SecretVersionsToStages response value.
