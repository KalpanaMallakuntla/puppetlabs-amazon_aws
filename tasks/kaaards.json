Amazon Kinesis Analytics reads reference data (that is, an Amazon S3 object) and creates an in-application table within your application. In the request, you provide the source (S3 bucket name and object key name), name of the in-application table to create, and the necessary mapping information that describes how data in Amazon S3 object maps to columns in the resulting in-application table.  For conceptual information, see Configuring Application Input. For the limits on data sources you can add to your application, see Limits.   This operation requires permissions to perform the kinesisanalytics:AddApplicationOutput action. ",
