	"description": "Deletes the specified alias. You cannot perform this operation on an alias in a different AWS account.  Because an alias is not a property of a CMK, you can delete and change the aliases of a CMK without affecting the CMK. Also, aliases do not appear in the response from the DescribeKey operation. To get the aliases of all CMKs, use the ListAliases operation.  Each CMK can have multiple aliases. To change the alias of a CMK, use DeleteAlias to delete the current alias and CreateAlias to create a new alias. To associate an existing alias with a different customer master key (CMK), call UpdateAlias.",
