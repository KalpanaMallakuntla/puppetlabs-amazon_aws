	"description": "Creates an Amazon EKS control plane.  The Amazon EKS control plane consists of control plane instances that run the Kubernetes software, like etcd and the API server. The control plane runs in an account managed by AWS, and the Kubernetes API is exposed via the Amazon EKS API server endpoint. Amazon EKS worker nodes run in your AWS account and connect to your cluster's control plane via the Kubernetes API server endpoint and a certificate file that is created for your cluster. The cluster control plane is provisioned across multiple Availability Zones and fronted by an Elastic Load Balancing Network Load Balancer. Amazon EKS also provisions elastic network interfaces in your VPC subnets to provide connectivity from the control plane instances to the worker nodes (for example, to support kubectl exec, logs, and proxy data flows). After you create an Amazon EKS cluster, you must configure your Kubernetes tooling to communicate with the API server and launch worker nodes into your cluster. For more information, see Managing Cluster Authentication and Launching Amazon EKS Worker Nodesin the Amazon EKS User Guide.",
