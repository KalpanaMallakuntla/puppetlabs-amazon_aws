	"description": "Gets face detection results for a Amazon Rekognition Video analysis started by StartFaceDetection. Face detection with Amazon Rekognition Video is an asynchronous operation. You start face detection by calling StartFaceDetection which returns a job identifier (JobId). When the face detection operation finishes, Amazon Rekognition Video publishes a completion status to the Amazon Simple Notification Service topic registered in the initial call to StartFaceDetection. To get the results of the face detection operation, first check that the status value published to the Amazon SNS topic is SUCCEEDED. If so, call GetFaceDetection and pass the job identifier (JobId) from the initial call to StartFaceDetection.  GetFaceDetection returns an array of detected faces (Faces) sorted by the time the faces were detected.  Use MaxResults parameter to limit the number of labels returned. If there are more results than specified in MaxResults, the value of NextToken in the operation response contains a pagination token for getting the next set of results. To get the next page of results, call GetFaceDetection and populate the NextToken request parameter with the token value returned from the previous call to GetFaceDetection.",
