	"description": "Updates the name and/or the path of the specified server certificate stored in IAM. For more information about working with server certificates, see Working with Server Certificates in the IAM User Guide. This topic also includes a list of AWS services that can use the server certificates that you manage with IAM.  You should understand the implications of changing a server certificate's path or name. For more information, see Renaming a Server Certificate in the IAM User Guide.   The person making the request (the principal), must have permission to change the server certificate with the old name and the new name. For example, to change the certificate named ProductionCert to ProdCert, the principal must have a policy that allows them to update both certificates. If the principal has permission to update the ProductionCert group, but not the ProdCert certificate, then the update fails. For more information about permissions, see Access Management in the IAM User Guide. ",
