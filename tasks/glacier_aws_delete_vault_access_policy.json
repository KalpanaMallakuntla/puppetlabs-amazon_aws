	"description": "This operation deletes the access policy associated with the specified vault. The operation is eventually consistent; that is, it might take some time for Amazon Glacier to completely remove the access policy, and you might still see the effect of the policy for a short time after you send the delete request. This operation is idempotent. You can invoke delete multiple times, even if there is no policy associated with the vault. For more information about vault access policies, see Amazon Glacier Access Control with Vault Access Policies. ",
