	"description": "Replaces the existing list of server certificate thumbprints associated with an OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider resource object with a new list of thumbprints. The list that you pass with this operation completely replaces the existing list of thumbprints. (The lists are not merged.) Typically, you need to update a thumbprint only when the identity provider's certificate changes, which occurs rarely. However, if the provider's certificate does change, any attempt to assume an IAM role that specifies the OIDC provider as a principal fails until the certificate thumbprint is updated.  Trust for the OIDC provider is derived from the provider's certificate and is validated by the thumbprint. Therefore, it is best to limit access to the UpdateOpenIDConnectProviderThumbprint operation to highly privileged users. ",
