For more information, see Renaming Users and Groups in the IAM User Guide.   The person making the request (the principal), must have permission to change the role group with the old name and the new name. For example, to change the group named Managers to MGRs, the principal must have a policy that allows them to update both groups. If the principal has permission to update the Managers group, but not the MGRs group, then the update fails. For more information about permissions, see Access Management.  ",
