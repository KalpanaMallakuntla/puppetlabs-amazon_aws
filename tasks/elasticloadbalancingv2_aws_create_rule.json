Rules are evaluated in priority order, from the lowest value to the highest value. When the conditions for a rule are met, its actions are performed. If the conditions for no rules are met, the actions for the default rule are performed. For more information, see Listener Rules in the Application Load Balancers Guide. To view your current rules, use DescribeRules. To update a rule, use ModifyRule. To set the priorities of your rules, use SetRulePriorities. To delete a rule, use DeleteRule.",
