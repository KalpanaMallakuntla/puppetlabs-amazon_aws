This operation can be used to disable an IAM user's signing certificate as part of a certificate rotation work flow. If the UserName field is not specified, the user name is determined implicitly based on the AWS access key ID used to sign the request. This operation works for access keys under the AWS account. Consequently, you can use this operation to manage AWS account root user credentials even if the AWS account has no associated users.",
