	"description": "Creates an IPSet, which you use to specify which web requests you want to allow or block based on the IP addresses that the requests originate from. For example, if you're receiving a lot of requests from one or more individual IP addresses or one or more ranges of IP addresses and you want to block the requests, you can create an IPSet that contains those IP addresses and then configure AWS WAF to block the requests.  To create and configure an IPSet, perform the following steps:   Use GetChangeToken to get the change token that you provide in the ChangeToken parameter of a CreateIPSet request.   Submit a CreateIPSet request.   Use GetChangeToken to get the change token that you provide in the ChangeToken parameter of an UpdateIPSet request.   Submit an UpdateIPSet request to specify the IP addresses that you want AWS WAF to watch for.   For more information about how to use the AWS WAF API to allow or block HTTP requests, see the AWS WAF Developer Guide.",
