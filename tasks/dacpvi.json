A private virtual interface can be connected to either a Direct Connect gateway or a Virtual Private Gateway (VGW). Connecting the private virtual interface to a Direct Connect gateway enables the possibility for connecting to multiple VPCs, including VPCs in different AWS Regions. Connecting the private virtual interface to a VGW only provides access to a single VPC within the same Region.",
