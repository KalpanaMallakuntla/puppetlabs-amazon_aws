	"description": "Gets a Boolean value that indicates whether automatic rotation of the key material is enabled for the specified customer master key (CMK). The result of this operation varies with the key state of the CMK. For details, see How Key State Affects Use of a Customer Master Key in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.   Disabled: The key rotation status does not change when you disable a CMK. However, while the CMK is disabled, AWS KMS does not rotate the backing key.   Pending deletion: While a CMK is pending deletion, its key rotation status is false and AWS KMS does not rotate the backing key. If you cancel the deletion, the original key rotation status is restored.   To perform this operation on a CMK in a different AWS account, specify the key ARN in the value of the KeyId parameter.",
