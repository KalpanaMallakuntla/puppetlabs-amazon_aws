Existing tasks and services that reference an INACTIVE task definition continue to run without disruption. Existing services that reference an INACTIVE task definition can still scale up or down by modifying the service's desired count. You cannot use an INACTIVE task definition to run new tasks or create new services, and you cannot update an existing service to reference an INACTIVE task definition (although there may be up to a 10-minute window following deregistration where these restrictions have not yet taken effect).  At this time, INACTIVE task definitions remain discoverable in your account indefinitely; however, this behavior is subject to change in the future, so you should not rely on INACTIVE task definitions persisting beyond the lifecycle of any associated tasks and services.
