	"description": "Allows the update of one or more parameters of a database in Amazon Lightsail. Parameter updates don't cause outages; therefore, their application is not subject to the preferred maintenance window. However, there are two ways in which paramater updates are applied: dynamic or pending-reboot. Parameters marked with a dynamic apply type are applied immediately. Parameters marked with a pending-reboot apply type are applied only after the database is rebooted using the reboot relational database operation. The update relational database parameters operation supports tag-based access control via resource tags applied to the resource identified by relationalDatabaseName. For more information, see the Lightsail Dev Guide.",
