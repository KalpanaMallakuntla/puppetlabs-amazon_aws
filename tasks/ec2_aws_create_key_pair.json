The private key is returned as an unencrypted PEM encoded PKCS#1 private key. If a key with the specified name already exists, Amazon EC2 returns an error. You can have up to five thousand key pairs per region. The key pair returned to you is available only in the region in which you create it. If you prefer, you can create your own key pair using a third-party tool and upload it to any region using ImportKeyPair.
