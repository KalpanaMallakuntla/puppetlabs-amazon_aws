Before players can be added, a game session must have an ACTIVE status, have a creation policy of ALLOW_ALL, and have an open player slot. To add a single player to a game session, use CreatePlayerSession. To create player sessions, specify a game session ID, a list of player IDs, and optionally a set of player data strings. If successful, the players are added to the game session and a set of new PlayerSession objects is returned. Player sessions cannot be updated.  Available in Amazon GameLift Local.
