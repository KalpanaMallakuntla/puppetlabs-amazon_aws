	"description": "Gets detailed information about a specified number of requests--a sample--that AWS WAF randomly selects from among the first 5,000 requests that your AWS resource received during a time range that you choose. You can specify a sample size of up to 500 requests, and you can specify any time range in the previous three hours.  GetSampledRequests returns a time range, which is usually the time range that you specified. However, if your resource (such as a CloudFront distribution) received 5,000 requests before the specified time range elapsed, GetSampledRequests returns an updated time range. This new time range indicates the actual period during which AWS WAF selected the requests in the sample.",
