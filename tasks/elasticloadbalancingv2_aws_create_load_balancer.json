	"description": "Creates an Application Load Balancer or a Network Load Balancer. When you create a load balancer, you can specify security groups, public subnets, IP address type, and tags. Otherwise, you could do so later using SetSecurityGroups, SetSubnets, SetIpAddressType, and AddTags. To create listeners for your load balancer, use CreateListener. To describe your current load balancers, see DescribeLoadBalancers. When you are finished with a load balancer, you can delete it using DeleteLoadBalancer. For limit information, see Limits for Your Application Load Balancer in the Application Load Balancers Guide and Limits for Your Network Load Balancer in the Network Load Balancers Guide. This operation is idempotent, which means that it completes at most one time. If you attempt to create multiple load balancers with the same settings, each call succeeds. For more information, see Application Load Balancers in the Application Load Balancers Guide and Network Load Balancers in the Network Load Balancers Guide.",
