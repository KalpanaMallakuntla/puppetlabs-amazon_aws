When you start a stopped instance, Lightsail assigns a new public IP address to the instance. To use the same IP address after stopping and starting an instance, create a static IP address and attach it to the instance. For more information, see the Lightsail Dev Guide.  The start instance operation supports tag-based access control via resource tags applied to the resource identified by instanceName. For more information, see the Lightsail Dev Guide.",
