	"description": "Deletes key material that you previously imported. This operation makes the specified customer master key (CMK) unusable. For more information about importing key material into AWS KMS, see Importing Key Material in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide. You cannot perform this operation on a CMK in a different AWS account. When the specified CMK is in the PendingDeletion state, this operation does not change the CMK's state. Otherwise, it changes the CMK's state to PendingImport. After you delete key material, you can use ImportKeyMaterial to reimport the same key material into the CMK. The result of this operation varies with the key state of the CMK. For details, see How Key State Affects Use of a Customer Master Key in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.",
