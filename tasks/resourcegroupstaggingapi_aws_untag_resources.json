The operation succeeds even if you attempt to remove tags from a resource that were already removed. Note the following:   To remove tags from a resource, you need the necessary permissions for the service that the resource belongs to as well as permissions for removing tags. For more information, see Obtaining Permissions for Tagging in the AWS Resource Groups and Tag Editor User Guide.   You can only tag resources that are located in the specified region for the AWS account.  ",
