	"description": "Creates a link aggregation group (LAG) with the specified number of bundled physical connections between the customer network and a specific AWS Direct Connect location. A LAG is a logical interface that uses the Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) to aggregate multiple interfaces, enabling you to treat them as a single interface. All connections in a LAG must use the same bandwidth and must terminate at the same AWS Direct Connect endpoint. You can have up to 10 connections per LAG. Regardless of this limit, if you request more connections for the LAG than AWS Direct Connect can allocate on a single endpoint, no LAG is created. You can specify an existing physical connection or interconnect to include in the LAG (which counts towards the total number of connections). Doing so interrupts the current physical connection or hosted connections, and re-establishes them as a member of the LAG. The LAG will be created on the same AWS Direct Connect endpoint to which the connection terminates. Any virtual interfaces associated with the connection are automatically disassociated and re-associated with the LAG. The connection ID does not change. If the AWS account used to create a LAG is a registered AWS Direct Connect partner, the LAG is automatically enabled to host sub-connections. For a LAG owned by a partner, any associated virtual interfaces cannot be directly configured.",
