	"description": "Updates the current run-time configuration for the specified fleet, which tells Amazon GameLift how to launch server processes on instances in the fleet. You can update a fleet's run-time configuration at any time after the fleet is created; it does not need to be in an ACTIVE status. To update run-time configuration, specify the fleet ID and provide a RuntimeConfiguration object with the updated collection of server process configurations. Each instance in a Amazon GameLift fleet checks regularly for an updated run-time configuration and changes how it launches server processes to comply with the latest version. Existing server processes are not affected by the update; they continue to run until they end, while Amazon GameLift simply adds new server processes to fit the current run-time configuration. As a result, the run-time configuration changes are applied gradually as existing processes shut down and new processes are launched in Amazon GameLift's normal process recycling activity.
