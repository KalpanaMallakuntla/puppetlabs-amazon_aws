	"description": "Creates a SizeConstraintSet. You then use UpdateSizeConstraintSet to identify the part of a web request that you want AWS WAF to check for length, such as the length of the User-Agent header or the length of the query string. For example, you can create a SizeConstraintSet that matches any requests that have a query string that is longer than 100 bytes. You can then configure AWS WAF to reject those requests. To create and configure a SizeConstraintSet, perform the following steps:   Use GetChangeToken to get the change token that you provide in the ChangeToken parameter of a CreateSizeConstraintSet request.   Submit a CreateSizeConstraintSet request.   Use GetChangeToken to get the change token that you provide in the ChangeToken parameter of an UpdateSizeConstraintSet request.   Submit an UpdateSizeConstraintSet request to specify the part of the request that you want AWS WAF to inspect (for example, the header or the URI) and the value that you want AWS WAF to watch for.   For more information about how to use the AWS WAF API to allow or block HTTP requests, see the AWS WAF Developer Guide.",
