	"description": "Creates a new Amazon ECS cluster. By default, your account receives a default cluster when you launch your first container instance. However, you can create your own cluster with a unique name with the CreateCluster action.  When you call the CreateCluster API operation, Amazon ECS attempts to create the service-linked role for your account so that required resources in other AWS services can be managed on your behalf. However, if the IAM user that makes the call does not have permissions to create the service-linked role, it is not created. For more information, see Using Service-Linked Roles for Amazon ECS in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. ",
