	"description": "Stops a running task. When StopTask is called on a task, the equivalent of docker stop is issued to the containers running in the task. This results in a SIGTERM and a default 30-second timeout, after which SIGKILL is sent and the containers are forcibly stopped. If the container handles the SIGTERM gracefully and exits within 30 seconds from receiving it, no SIGKILL is sent.  The default 30-second timeout can be configured on the Amazon ECS container agent with the ECS_CONTAINER_STOP_TIMEOUT variable. For more information, see Amazon ECS Container Agent Configuration in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. ",
