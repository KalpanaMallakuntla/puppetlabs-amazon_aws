However, it might take some time for the update to complete. You can call DescribeGatewayInformation to verify the gateway is in the STATE_RUNNING state.   A software update forces a system restart of your gateway. You can minimize the chance of any disruption to your applications by increasing your iSCSI Initiators' timeouts. For more information about increasing iSCSI Initiator timeouts for Windows and Linux, see Customizing Your Windows iSCSI Settings and Customizing Your Linux iSCSI Settings, respectively. ",
