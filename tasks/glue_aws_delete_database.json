After completing this operation, you will no longer have access to the tables (and all table versions and partitions that might belong to the tables) and the user-defined functions in the deleted database. AWS Glue deletes these 'orphaned' resources asynchronously in a timely manner, at the discretion of the service. To ensure immediate deletion of all related resources, before calling DeleteDatabase, use DeleteTableVersion or BatchDeleteTableVersion, DeletePartition or BatchDeletePartition, DeleteUserDefinedFunction, and DeleteTable or BatchDeleteTable, to delete any resources that belong to the database.
