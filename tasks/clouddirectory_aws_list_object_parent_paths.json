Use this API to evaluate all parents for an object. The call returns all objects from the root of the directory up to the requested object. The API returns the number of paths based on user-defined MaxResults, in case there are multiple paths to the parent. The order of the paths and nodes returned is consistent among multiple API calls unless the objects are deleted or moved. Paths not leading to the directory root are ignored from the target object.",
