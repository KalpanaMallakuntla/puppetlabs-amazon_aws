	"description": "Deletes the queue specified by the QueueUrl, regardless of the queue's contents. If the specified queue doesn't exist, Amazon SQS returns a successful response.  Be careful with the DeleteQueue action: When you delete a queue, any messages in the queue are no longer available.   When you delete a queue, the deletion process takes up to 60 seconds. Requests you send involving that queue during the 60 seconds might succeed. For example, a  SendMessage  request might succeed, but after 60 seconds the queue and the message you sent no longer exist. When you delete a queue, you must wait at least 60 seconds before creating a queue with the same name.  Cross-account permissions don't apply to this action. For more information, see see Grant Cross-Account Permissions to a Role and a User Name in the Amazon Simple Queue Service Developer Guide. ",
