While the deletion request is in process, the delivery stream is in the DELETING state. To check the state of a delivery stream, use DescribeDeliveryStream. While the delivery stream is DELETING state, the service might continue to accept the records, but it doesn't make any guarantees with respect to delivering the data. Therefore, as a best practice, you should first stop any applications that are sending records before deleting a delivery stream.",
