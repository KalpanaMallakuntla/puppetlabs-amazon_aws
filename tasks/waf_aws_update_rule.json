	"description": "Inserts or deletes Predicate objects in a Rule. Each Predicate object identifies a predicate, such as a ByteMatchSet or an IPSet, that specifies the web requests that you want to allow, block, or count. If you add more than one predicate to a Rule, a request must match all of the specifications to be allowed, blocked, or counted. For example, suppose that you add the following to a Rule:    A ByteMatchSet that matches the value BadBot in the User-Agent header   An IPSet that matches the IP address 192.0.2.44    You then add the Rule to a WebACL and specify that you want to block requests that satisfy the Rule. For a request to be blocked, the User-Agent header in the request must contain the value BadBot and the request must originate from the IP address 192.0.2.44. To create and configure a Rule, perform the following steps:   Create and update the predicates that you want to include in the Rule.   Create the Rule. See CreateRule.   Use GetChangeToken to get the change token that you provide in the ChangeToken parameter of an UpdateRule request.   Submit an UpdateRule request to add predicates to the Rule.   Create and update a WebACL that contains the Rule. See CreateWebACL.   If you want to replace one ByteMatchSet or IPSet with another, you delete the existing one and add the new one.
