	"description": "Deletes a specified service within a cluster. You can delete a service if you have no running tasks in it and the desired task count is zero. If the service is actively maintaining tasks, you cannot delete it, and you must update the service to a desired task count of zero. For more information, see UpdateService.  When you delete a service, if there are still running tasks that require cleanup, the service status moves from ACTIVE to DRAINING, and the service is no longer visible in the console or in the ListServices API operation. After the tasks have stopped, then the service status moves from DRAINING to INACTIVE. Services in the DRAINING or INACTIVE status can still be viewed with the DescribeServices API operation. However, in the future, INACTIVE services may be cleaned up and purged from Amazon ECS record keeping, and DescribeServices calls on those services return a ServiceNotFoundException error.   If you attempt to create a new service with the same name as an existing service in either ACTIVE or DRAINING status, you receive an error. ",
