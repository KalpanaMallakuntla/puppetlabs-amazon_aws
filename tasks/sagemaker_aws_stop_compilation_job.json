If the job hasn't stopped, it sends the SIGKILL signal. When it receives a StopCompilationJob request, Amazon SageMaker changes the CompilationJobSummary$CompilationJobStatus of the job to Stopping. After Amazon SageMaker stops the job, it sets the CompilationJobSummary$CompilationJobStatus to Stopped. ",
