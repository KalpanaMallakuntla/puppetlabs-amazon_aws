	"description": "Set the capacity of an Aurora Serverless DB cluster to a specific value. Aurora Serverless scales seamlessly based on the workload on the DB cluster. In some cases, the capacity might not scale fast enough to meet a sudden change in workload, such as a large number of new transactions. Call ModifyCurrentDBClusterCapacity to set the capacity explicitly. After this call sets the DB cluster capacity, Aurora Serverless can automatically scale the DB cluster based on the cooldown period for scaling up and the cooldown period for scaling down. For more information about Aurora Serverless, see Using Amazon Aurora Serverless in the Amazon Aurora User Guide.  If you call ModifyCurrentDBClusterCapacity with the default TimeoutAction, connections that prevent Aurora Serverless from finding a scaling point might be dropped. For more information about scaling points, see  Autoscaling for Aurora Serverless in the Amazon Aurora User Guide.   This action only applies to Aurora DB clusters. ",
