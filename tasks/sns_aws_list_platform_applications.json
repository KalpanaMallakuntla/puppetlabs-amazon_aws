The results for ListPlatformApplications are paginated and return a limited list of applications, up to 100. If additional records are available after the first page results, then a NextToken string will be returned. To receive the next page, you call ListPlatformApplications using the NextToken string received from the previous call. When there are no more records to return, NextToken will be null. For more information, see Using Amazon SNS Mobile Push Notifications.  This action is throttled at 15 transactions per second (TPS).",
