For each ByteMatchTuple object, you specify the following values:    Whether to insert or delete the object from the array. If you want to change a ByteMatchSetUpdate object, you delete the existing object and add a new one.   The part of a web request that you want AWS WAF to inspect, such as a query string or the value of the User-Agent header.    The bytes (typically a string that corresponds with ASCII characters) that you want AWS WAF to look for. For more information, including how you specify the values for the AWS WAF API and the AWS CLI or SDKs, see TargetString in the ByteMatchTuple data type.    Where to look, such as at the beginning or the end of a query string.   Whether to perform any conversions on the request, such as converting it to lowercase, before inspecting it for the specified string.   For example, you can add a ByteMatchSetUpdate object that matches web requests in which User-Agent headers contain the string BadBot. You can then configure AWS WAF to block those requests. To create and configure a ByteMatchSet, perform the following steps:   Create a ByteMatchSet. For more information, see CreateByteMatchSet.   Use GetChangeToken to get the change token that you provide in the ChangeToken parameter of an UpdateByteMatchSet request.   Submit an UpdateByteMatchSet request to specify the part of the request that you want AWS WAF to inspect (for example, the header or the URI) and the value that you want AWS WAF to watch for.   For more information about how to use the AWS WAF API to allow or block HTTP requests, see the AWS WAF Developer Guide.",
