	"description": "Gets the content moderation analysis results for a Amazon Rekognition Video analysis started by . Content moderation analysis of a video is an asynchronous operation. You start analysis by calling . which returns a job identifier (JobId). When analysis finishes, Amazon Rekognition Video publishes a completion status to the Amazon Simple Notification Service topic registered in the initial call to StartContentModeration. To get the results of the content moderation analysis, first check that the status value published to the Amazon SNS topic is SUCCEEDED. If so, call GetCelebrityDetection and pass the job identifier (JobId) from the initial call to StartCelebrityDetection.  For more information, see Working with Stored Videos in the Amazon Rekognition Devlopers Guide.  GetContentModeration returns detected content moderation labels, and the time they are detected, in an array, ModerationLabels, of objects.  By default, the moderated labels are returned sorted by time, in milliseconds from the start of the video. You can also sort them by moderated label by specifying NAME for the SortBy input parameter.  Since video analysis can return a large number of results, use the MaxResults parameter to limit the number of labels returned in a single call to GetContentModeration. If there are more results than specified in MaxResults, the value of NextToken in the operation response contains a pagination token for getting the next set of results. To get the next page of results, call GetContentModeration and populate the NextToken request parameter with the value of NextToken returned from the previous call to GetContentModeration. For more information, see Detecting Unsafe Content in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.",
