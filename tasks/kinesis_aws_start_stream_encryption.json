	"description": "Enables or updates server-side encryption using an AWS KMS key for a specified stream.  Starting encryption is an asynchronous operation. Upon receiving the request, Kinesis Data Streams returns immediately and sets the status of the stream to UPDATING. After the update is complete, Kinesis Data Streams sets the status of the stream back to ACTIVE. Updating or applying encryption normally takes a few seconds to complete, but it can take minutes. You can continue to read and write data to your stream while its status is UPDATING. Once the status of the stream is ACTIVE, encryption begins for records written to the stream.  API Limits: You can successfully apply a new AWS KMS key for server-side encryption 25 times in a rolling 24-hour period. Note: It can take up to 5 seconds after the stream is in an ACTIVE status before all records written to the stream are encrypted. After you enable encryption, you can verify that encryption is applied by inspecting the API response from PutRecord or PutRecords.",
