	"description": "Deregisters an Amazon ECS container instance from the specified cluster. This instance is no longer available to run tasks. If you intend to use the container instance for some other purpose after deregistration, you should stop all of the tasks running on the container instance before deregistration. That prevents any orphaned tasks from consuming resources. Deregistering a container instance removes the instance from a cluster, but it does not terminate the EC2 instance. If you are finished using the instance, be sure to terminate it in the Amazon EC2 console to stop billing.  If you terminate a running container instance, Amazon ECS automatically deregisters the instance from your cluster (stopped container instances or instances with disconnected agents are not automatically deregistered when terminated).
