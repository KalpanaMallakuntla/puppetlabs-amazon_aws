	"description": "Retrieves information about the specified version of the specified managed policy, including the policy document.  Policies returned by this API are URL-encoded compliant with RFC 3986. You can use a URL decoding method to convert the policy back to plain JSON text. For example, if you use Java, you can use the decode method of the java.net.URLDecoder utility class in the Java SDK. Other languages and SDKs provide similar functionality.  To list the available versions for a policy, use ListPolicyVersions. This API retrieves information about managed policies. To retrieve information about an inline policy that is embedded in a user, group, or role, use the GetUserPolicy, GetGroupPolicy, or GetRolePolicy API. For more information about the types of policies, see Managed Policies and Inline Policies in the IAM User Guide. For more information about managed policy versions, see Versioning for Managed Policies in the IAM User Guide.",
