	"description": "Attaches the specified managed policy to the specified IAM role. When you attach a managed policy to a role, the managed policy becomes part of the role's permission (access) policy.  You cannot use a managed policy as the role's trust policy. The role's trust policy is created at the same time as the role, using CreateRole. You can update a role's trust policy using UpdateAssumeRolePolicy.  Use this API to attach a managed policy to a role. To embed an inline policy in a role, use PutRolePolicy. For more information about policies, see Managed Policies and Inline Policies in the IAM User Guide.",
