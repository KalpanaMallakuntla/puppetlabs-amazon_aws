For information about setting a notification configuration on a vault, see SetVaultNotifications. If a notification configuration for a vault is not set, the operation returns a 404 Not Found error. For more information about vault notifications, see Configuring Vault Notifications in Amazon Glacier.  An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions). However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don't have any permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to perform specific actions. For more information, see Access Control Using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). For conceptual information and underlying REST API, see Configuring Vault Notifications in Amazon Glacier and Get Vault Notification Configuration  in the Amazon Glacier Developer Guide. ",
