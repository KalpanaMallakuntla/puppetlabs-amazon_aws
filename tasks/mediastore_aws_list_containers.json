Or you can include the MaxResults parameter to receive a limited number of containers in each response. In this case, the response includes a token. To get the next set of containers, send the command again, this time with the NextToken parameter (with the returned token as its value). The next set of responses appears, with a token if there are still more containers to receive.  See also DescribeContainer, which gets the properties of one container. ",
