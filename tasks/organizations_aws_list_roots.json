These operations can occasionally return an empty set of results even when there are more results available. The NextToken response parameter value is null only when there are no more results to display.  This operation can be called only from the organization's master account.  Policy types can be enabled and disabled in roots. This is distinct from whether they are available in the organization. When you enable all features, you make policy types available for use in that organization. Individual policy types can then be enabled and disabled in a root. To see the availability of a policy type in an organization, use DescribeOrganization. ",
