	"description": "Creates a subnet in an existing VPC. When you create each subnet, you provide the VPC ID and IPv4 CIDR block for the subnet. After you create a subnet, you can't change its CIDR block. The size of the subnet's IPv4 CIDR block can be the same as a VPC's IPv4 CIDR block, or a subset of a VPC's IPv4 CIDR block. If you create more than one subnet in a VPC, the subnets' CIDR blocks must not overlap. The smallest IPv4 subnet (and VPC) you can create uses a /28 netmask (16 IPv4 addresses), and the largest uses a /16 netmask (65,536 IPv4 addresses). If you've associated an IPv6 CIDR block with your VPC, you can create a subnet with an IPv6 CIDR block that uses a /64 prefix length.   AWS reserves both the first four and the last IPv4 address in each subnet's CIDR block. They're not available for use.  If you add more than one subnet to a VPC, they're set up in a star topology with a logical router in the middle. If you launch an instance in a VPC using an Amazon EBS-backed AMI, the IP address doesn't change if you stop and restart the instance (unlike a similar instance launched outside a VPC, which gets a new IP address when restarted). It's therefore possible to have a subnet with no running instances (they're all stopped), but no remaining IP addresses available. For more information about subnets, see Your VPC and Subnets in the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide.",
