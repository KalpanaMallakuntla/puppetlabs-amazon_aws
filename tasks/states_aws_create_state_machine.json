A state machine consists of a collection of states that can do work (Task states), determine to which states to transition next (Choice states), stop an execution with an error (Fail states), and so on. State machines are specified using a JSON-based, structured language.  This operation is eventually consistent. The results are best effort and may not reflect very recent updates and changes. ",
