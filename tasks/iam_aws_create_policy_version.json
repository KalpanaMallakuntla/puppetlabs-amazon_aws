If the policy has five versions, you must delete an existing version using DeletePolicyVersion before you create a new version. Optionally, you can set the new version as the policy's default version. The default version is the version that is in effect for the IAM users, groups, and roles to which the policy is attached. For more information about managed policy versions, see Versioning for Managed Policies in the IAM User Guide.",
