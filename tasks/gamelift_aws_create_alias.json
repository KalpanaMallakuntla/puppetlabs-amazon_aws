	"description": "Creates an alias for a fleet. In most situations, you can use an alias ID in place of a fleet ID. By using a fleet alias instead of a specific fleet ID, you can switch gameplay and players to a new fleet without changing your game client or other game components. For example, for games in production, using an alias allows you to seamlessly redirect your player base to a new game server update.  Amazon GameLift supports two types of routing strategies for aliases: simple and terminal. A simple alias points to an active fleet. A terminal alias is used to display messaging or link to a URL instead of routing players to an active fleet. For example, you might use a terminal alias when a game version is no longer supported and you want to direct players to an upgrade site.  To create a fleet alias, specify an alias name, routing strategy, and optional description. Each simple alias can point to only one fleet, but a fleet can have multiple aliases. If successful, a new alias record is returned, including an alias ID, which you can reference when creating a game session. You can reassign an alias to another fleet by calling UpdateAlias. Alias-related operations include:    CreateAlias     ListAliases     DescribeAlias     UpdateAlias     DeleteAlias     ResolveAlias   ",
