	"description": "Creates an X.509 certificate using the specified certificate signing request.  Note: The CSR must include a public key that is either an RSA key with a length of at least 2048 bits or an ECC key from NIST P-256 or NIST P-384 curves.   Note: Reusing the same certificate signing request (CSR) results in a distinct certificate. You can create multiple certificates in a batch by creating a directory, copying multiple .csr files into that directory, and then specifying that directory on the command line. The following commands show how to create a batch of certificates given a batch of CSRs. Assuming a set of CSRs are located inside of the directory my-csr-directory: On Linux and OS X, the command is: $ ls my-csr-directory/ | xargs -I {} aws iot create-certificate-from-csr --certificate-signing-request file://my-csr-directory/{} This command lists all of the CSRs in my-csr-directory and pipes each CSR file name to the aws iot create-certificate-from-csr AWS CLI command to create a certificate for the corresponding CSR. The aws iot create-certificate-from-csr part of the command can also be run in parallel to speed up the certificate creation process: $ ls my-csr-directory/ | xargs -P 10 -I {} aws iot create-certificate-from-csr --certificate-signing-request file://my-csr-directory/{} On Windows PowerShell, the command to create certificates for all CSRs in my-csr-directory is: &gt; ls -Name my-csr-directory | %{aws iot create-certificate-from-csr --certificate-signing-request file://my-csr-directory/$_} On a Windows command prompt, the command to create certificates for all CSRs in my-csr-directory is: &gt; forfiles /p my-csr-directory /c 'cmd /c aws iot create-certificate-from-csr --certificate-signing-request file://@path'",
