Access Control  You can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon SWF resources as follows:   Use a Resource element with the domain name to limit the action to only specified domains.   Use an Action element to allow or deny permission to call this action.   You cannot use an IAM policy to constrain this action's parameters.   If the caller doesn't have sufficient permissions to invoke the action, or the parameter values fall outside the specified constraints, the action fails. The associated event attribute's cause parameter is set to OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED. For details and example IAM policies, see Using IAM to Manage Access to Amazon SWF Workflows in the Amazon SWF Developer Guide.",
