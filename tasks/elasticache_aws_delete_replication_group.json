If the replication group has only one primary, you can optionally delete only the read replicas, while retaining the primary by setting RetainPrimaryCluster=true. When you receive a successful response from this operation, Amazon ElastiCache immediately begins deleting the selected resources; you cannot cancel or revert this operation.  This operation is valid for Redis only. ",
