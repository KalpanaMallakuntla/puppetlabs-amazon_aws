	"description": "Creates a stream for delivering one or more large files in chunks over MQTT. A stream transports data bytes in chunks or blocks packaged as MQTT messages from a source like S3. You can have one or more files associated with a stream. The total size of a file associated with the stream cannot exceed more than 2 MB. The stream will be created with version 0. If a stream is created with the same streamID as a stream that existed and was deleted within last 90 days, we will resurrect that old stream by incrementing the version by 1.",
