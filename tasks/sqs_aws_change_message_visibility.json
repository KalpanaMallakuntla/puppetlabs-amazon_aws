	"description": "Changes the visibility timeout of a specified message in a queue to a new value. The maximum allowed timeout value is 12 hours. For more information, see Visibility Timeout in the Amazon Simple Queue Service Developer Guide. For example, you have a message with a visibility timeout of 5 minutes. After 3 minutes, you call ChangeMessageVisibility with a timeout of 10 minutes. You can continue to call ChangeMessageVisibility to extend the visibility timeout to a maximum of 12 hours. If you try to extend the visibility timeout beyond 12 hours, your request is rejected. A message is considered to be in flight after it's received from a queue by a consumer, but not yet deleted from the queue. For standard queues, there can be a maximum of 120,000 inflight messages per queue. If you reach this limit, Amazon SQS returns the OverLimit error message. To avoid reaching the limit, you should delete messages from the queue after they're processed. You can also increase the number of queues you use to process your messages. For FIFO queues, there can be a maximum of 20,000 inflight messages per queue. If you reach this limit, Amazon SQS returns no error messages.  If you attempt to set the VisibilityTimeout to a value greater than the maximum time left, Amazon SQS returns an error. Amazon SQS doesn't automatically recalculate and increase the timeout to the maximum remaining time. Unlike with a queue, when you change the visibility timeout for a specific message the timeout value is applied immediately but isn't saved in memory for that message. If you don't delete a message after it is received, the visibility timeout for the message reverts to the original timeout value (not to the value you set using the ChangeMessageVisibility action) the next time the message is received.
