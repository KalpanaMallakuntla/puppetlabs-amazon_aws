Any replica to be added must be empty, must have the same name as the global table, must have the same key schema, and must have DynamoDB Streams enabled and must have same provisioned and maximum write capacity units.  Although you can use UpdateGlobalTable to add replicas and remove replicas in a single request, for simplicity we recommend that you issue separate requests for adding or removing replicas.   If global secondary indexes are specified, then the following conditions must also be met:     The global secondary indexes must have the same name.     The global secondary indexes must have the same hash key and sort key (if present).     The global secondary indexes must have the same provisioned and maximum write capacity units.   ",
