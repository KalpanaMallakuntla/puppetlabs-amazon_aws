	"description": "Adds or updates an inline policy document that is embedded in the specified IAM group. A user can also have managed policies attached to it. To attach a managed policy to a group, use AttachGroupPolicy. To create a new managed policy, use CreatePolicy. For information about policies, see Managed Policies and Inline Policies in the IAM User Guide. For information about limits on the number of inline policies that you can embed in a group, see Limitations on IAM Entities in the IAM User Guide.  Because policy documents can be large, you should use POST rather than GET when calling PutGroupPolicy. For general information about using the Query API with IAM, go to Making Query Requests in the IAM User Guide. ",
