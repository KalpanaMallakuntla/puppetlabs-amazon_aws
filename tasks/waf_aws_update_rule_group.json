To create and configure a RuleGroup, perform the following steps:   Create and update the Rules that you want to include in the RuleGroup. See CreateRule.   Use GetChangeToken to get the change token that you provide in the ChangeToken parameter of an UpdateRuleGroup request.   Submit an UpdateRuleGroup request to add Rules to the RuleGroup.   Create and update a WebACL that contains the RuleGroup. See CreateWebACL.   If you want to replace one Rule with another, you delete the existing one and add the new one.
