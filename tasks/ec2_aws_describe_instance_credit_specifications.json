	"description": "Describes the credit option for CPU usage of one or more of your T2 or T3 instances. The credit options are standard and unlimited. If you do not specify an instance ID, Amazon EC2 returns T2 and T3 instances with the unlimited credit option, as well as instances that were previously configured as T2 or T3 with the unlimited credit option. For example, if you resize a T2 instance, while it is configured as unlimited, to an M4 instance, Amazon EC2 returns the M4 instance. If you specify one or more instance IDs, Amazon EC2 returns the credit option (standard or unlimited) of those instances. If you specify an instance ID that is not valid, such as an instance that is not a T2 or T3 instance, an error is returned. Recently terminated instances might appear in the returned results. This interval is usually less than one hour. If an Availability Zone is experiencing a service disruption and you specify instance IDs in the affected zone, or do not specify any instance IDs at all, the call fails. If you specify only instance IDs in an unaffected zone, the call works normally. For more information, see Burstable Performance Instances in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide.",
