The command returns a public key, which you must store in the HSM. In addition to creating the HSM certificate, you must create an Amazon Redshift HSM configuration that provides a cluster the information needed to store and use encryption keys in the HSM. For more information, go to Hardware Security Modules in the Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide.",
