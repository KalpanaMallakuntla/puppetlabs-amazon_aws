This operation, along with ListChildren enables you to traverse the tree structure that makes up this root.  Always check the NextToken response parameter for a null value when calling a List* operation. These operations can occasionally return an empty set of results even when there are more results available. The NextToken response parameter value is null only when there are no more results to display.  This operation can be called only from the organization's master account.  In the current release, a child can have only a single parent.  ",
