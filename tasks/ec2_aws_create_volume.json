	"description": "Creates an EBS volume that can be attached to an instance in the same Availability Zone. The volume is created in the regional endpoint that you send the HTTP request to. For more information see Regions and Endpoints. You can create a new empty volume or restore a volume from an EBS snapshot. Any AWS Marketplace product codes from the snapshot are propagated to the volume. You can create encrypted volumes with the Encrypted parameter. Encrypted volumes may only be attached to instances that support Amazon EBS encryption. Volumes that are created from encrypted snapshots are also automatically encrypted. For more information, see Amazon EBS Encryption in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide. You can tag your volumes during creation. For more information, see Tagging Your Amazon EC2 Resources in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide.
