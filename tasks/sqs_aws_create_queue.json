	"description": "Creates a new standard or FIFO queue. You can pass one or more attributes in the request. Keep the following caveats in mind:   If you don't specify the FifoQueue attribute, Amazon SQS creates a standard queue.   You can't change the queue type after you create it and you can't convert an existing standard queue into a FIFO queue. You must either create a new FIFO queue for your application or delete your existing standard queue and recreate it as a FIFO queue. For more information, see Moving From a Standard Queue to a FIFO Queue in the Amazon Simple Queue Service Developer Guide.     If you don't provide a value for an attribute, the queue is created with the default value for the attribute.   If you delete a queue, you must wait at least 60 seconds before creating a queue with the same name.   To successfully create a new queue, you must provide a queue name that adheres to the limits related to queues and is unique within the scope of your queues. To get the queue URL, use the  GetQueueUrl  action.  GetQueueUrl  requires only the QueueName parameter. be aware of existing queue names:   If you provide the name of an existing queue along with the exact names and values of all the queue's attributes, CreateQueue returns the queue URL for the existing queue.   If the queue name, attribute names, or attribute values don't match an existing queue, CreateQueue returns an error.   Some actions take lists of parameters. These lists are specified using the param.n notation. Values of n are integers starting from 1. For example, a parameter list with two elements looks like this:  &amp;Attribute.1=first   &amp;Attribute.2=second   Cross-account permissions don't apply to this action. For more information, see see Grant Cross-Account Permissions to a Role and a User Name in the Amazon Simple Queue Service Developer Guide. ",
