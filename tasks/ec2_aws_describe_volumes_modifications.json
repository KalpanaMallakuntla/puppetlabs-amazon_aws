	"description": "Reports the current modification status of EBS volumes. Current-generation EBS volumes support modification of attributes including type, size, and (for io1 volumes) IOPS provisioning while either attached to or detached from an instance. Following an action from the API or the console to modify a volume, the status of the modification may be modifying, optimizing, completed, or failed. If a volume has never been modified, then certain elements of the returned VolumeModification objects are null.   You can also use CloudWatch Events to check the status of a modification to an EBS volume. For information about CloudWatch Events, see the Amazon CloudWatch Events User Guide. For more information, see Monitoring Volume Modifications' in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide.",
