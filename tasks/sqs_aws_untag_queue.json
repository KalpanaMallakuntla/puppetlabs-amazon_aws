	"description": "Remove cost allocation tags from the specified Amazon SQS queue. For an overview, see Tagging Your Amazon SQS Queues in the Amazon Simple Queue Service Developer Guide. When you use queue tags, keep the following guidelines in mind:   Adding more than 50 tags to a queue isn't recommended.   Tags don't have any semantic meaning. Amazon SQS interprets tags as character strings.   Tags are case-sensitive.   A new tag with a key identical to that of an existing tag overwrites the existing tag.   Tagging actions are limited to 5 TPS per AWS account. If your application requires a higher throughput, file a technical support request.   For a full list of tag restrictions, see Limits Related to Queues in the Amazon Simple Queue Service Developer Guide.  Cross-account permissions don't apply to this action. For more information, see see Grant Cross-Account Permissions to a Role and a User Name in the Amazon Simple Queue Service Developer Guide. ",
