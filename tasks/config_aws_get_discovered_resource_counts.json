	"description": "Returns the resource types, the number of each resource type, and the total number of resources that AWS Config is recording in this region for your AWS account.   Example    AWS Config is recording three resource types in the US East (Ohio) Region for your account: 25 EC2 instances, 20 IAM users, and 15 S3 buckets.   You make a call to the GetDiscoveredResourceCounts action and specify that you want all resource types.    AWS Config returns the following:   The resource types (EC2 instances, IAM users, and S3 buckets).   The number of each resource type (25, 20, and 15).   The total number of all resources (60).     The response is paginated. By default, AWS Config lists 100 ResourceCount objects on each page. You can customize this number with the limit parameter. The response includes a nextToken string. To get the next page of results, run the request again and specify the string for the nextToken parameter.  If you make a call to the GetDiscoveredResourceCounts action, you might not immediately receive resource counts in the following situations:   You are a new AWS Config customer.   You just enabled resource recording.   It might take a few minutes for AWS Config to record and count your resources. Wait a few minutes and then retry the GetDiscoveredResourceCounts action.  ",
