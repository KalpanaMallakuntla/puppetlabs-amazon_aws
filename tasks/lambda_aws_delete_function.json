If you are using the versioning feature and you don't specify a function version in your DeleteFunction request, AWS Lambda will delete the function, including all its versions, and any aliases pointing to the function versions. To delete a specific function version, you must provide the function version via the Qualifier parameter. For information about function versioning, see AWS Lambda Function Versioning and Aliases.  When you delete a function the associated resource policy is also deleted. You will need to delete the event source mappings explicitly. This operation requires permission for the lambda:DeleteFunction action.",
