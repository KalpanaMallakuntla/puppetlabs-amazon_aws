	"description": "Adds or updates an inline policy document that is embedded in the specified IAM role. When you embed an inline policy in a role, the inline policy is used as part of the role's access (permissions) policy. The role's trust policy is created at the same time as the role, using CreateRole. You can update a role's trust policy using UpdateAssumeRolePolicy. For more information about IAM roles, go to Using Roles to Delegate Permissions and Federate Identities. A role can also have a managed policy attached to it. To attach a managed policy to a role, use AttachRolePolicy. To create a new managed policy, use CreatePolicy. For information about policies, see Managed Policies and Inline Policies in the IAM User Guide. For information about limits on the number of inline policies that you can embed with a role, see Limitations on IAM Entities in the IAM User Guide.  Because policy documents can be large, you should use POST rather than GET when calling PutRolePolicy. For general information about using the Query API with IAM, go to Making Query Requests in the IAM User Guide. ",
