AWS Data Pipeline attempts to cancel instances associated with the pipeline that are currently being processed by task runners. Deleting a pipeline cannot be undone. You cannot query or restore a deleted pipeline. To temporarily pause a pipeline instead of deleting it, call SetStatus with the status set to PAUSE on individual components.
