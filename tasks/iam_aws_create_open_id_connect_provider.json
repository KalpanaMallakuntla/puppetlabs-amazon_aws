	"description": "Creates an IAM entity to describe an identity provider (IdP) that supports OpenID Connect (OIDC). The OIDC provider that you create with this operation can be used as a principal in a role's trust policy. Such a policy establishes a trust relationship between AWS and the OIDC provider. When you create the IAM OIDC provider, you specify the following:   The URL of the OIDC identity provider (IdP) to trust   A list of client IDs (also known as audiences) that identify the application or applications that are allowed to authenticate using the OIDC provider   A list of thumbprints of the server certificate(s) that the IdP uses.   You get all of this information from the OIDC IdP that you want to use to access AWS.  Because trust for the OIDC provider is derived from the IAM provider that this operation creates, it is best to limit access to the CreateOpenIDConnectProvider operation to highly privileged users.
