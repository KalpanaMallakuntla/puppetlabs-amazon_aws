	"description": "Creates an AWS account that is automatically a member of the organization whose credentials made the request. This is an asynchronous request that AWS performs in the background. Because CreateAccount operates asynchronously, it can return a successful completion message even though account initialization might still be in progress. You might need to wait a few minutes before you can successfully access the account. To check the status of the request, do one of the following:   Use the OperationId response element from this operation to provide as a parameter to the DescribeCreateAccountStatus operation.   Check the AWS CloudTrail log for the CreateAccountResult event. For information on using AWS CloudTrail with Organizations, see Monitoring the Activity in Your Organization in the AWS Organizations User Guide.    The user who calls the API to create an account must have the organizations:CreateAccount permission. If you enabled all features in the organization, AWS Organizations will create the required service-linked role named AWSServiceRoleForOrganizations. For more information, see AWS Organizations and Service-Linked Roles in the AWS Organizations User Guide. AWS Organizations preconfigures the new member account with a role (named OrganizationAccountAccessRole by default) that grants users in the master account administrator permissions in the new member account. Principals in the master account can assume the role. AWS Organizations clones the company name and address information for the new account from the organization's master account. This operation can be called only from the organization's master account. For more information about creating accounts, see Creating an AWS Account in Your Organization in the AWS Organizations User Guide.    When you create an account in an organization using the AWS Organizations console, API, or CLI commands, the information required for the account to operate as a standalone account, such as a payment method and signing the end user license agreement (EULA) is not automatically collected. If you must remove an account from your organization later, you can do so only after you provide the missing information. Follow the steps at  To leave an organization as a member account in the AWS Organizations User Guide.   If you get an exception that indicates that you exceeded your account limits for the organization, contact AWS Support.   If you get an exception that indicates that the operation failed because your organization is still initializing, wait one hour and then try again. If the error persists, contact AWS Support.     When you create a member account with this operation, you can choose whether to create the account with the IAM User and Role Access to Billing Information switch enabled. If you enable it, IAM users and roles that have appropriate permissions can view billing information for the account. If you disable it, only the account root user can access billing information. For information about how to disable this switch for an account, see Granting Access to Your Billing Information and Tools. ",
