	"description": "Generates a stickiness policy with sticky session lifetimes that follow that of an application-generated cookie. This policy can be associated only with HTTP/HTTPS listeners. This policy is similar to the policy created by CreateLBCookieStickinessPolicy, except that the lifetime of the special Elastic Load Balancing cookie, AWSELB, follows the lifetime of the application-generated cookie specified in the policy configuration. The load balancer only inserts a new stickiness cookie when the application response includes a new application cookie. If the application cookie is explicitly removed or expires, the session stops being sticky until a new application cookie is issued. For more information, see Application-Controlled Session Stickiness in the Classic Load Balancers Guide.",
