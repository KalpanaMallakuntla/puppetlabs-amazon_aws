When you receive a successful response from this operation, Amazon ElastiCache immediately begins deleting the cluster; you cannot cancel or revert this operation. This operation cannot be used to delete a cluster that is the last read replica of a replication group or node group (shard) that has Multi-AZ mode enabled or a cluster from a Redis (cluster mode enabled) replication group. This operation is not valid for Redis (cluster mode enabled) clusters.",
