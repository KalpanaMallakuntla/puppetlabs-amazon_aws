	"description": "Adds one or more tags to the resource, such as a workgroup. A tag is a label that you assign to an AWS Athena resource (a workgroup). Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define. Tags enable you to categorize resources (workgroups) in Athena, for example, by purpose, owner, or environment. Use a consistent set of tag keys to make it easier to search and filter workgroups in your account. For best practices, see AWS Tagging Strategies. The key length is from 1 (minimum) to 128 (maximum) Unicode characters in UTF-8. The tag value length is from 0 (minimum) to 256 (maximum) Unicode characters in UTF-8. You can use letters and numbers representable in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . _ : / @. Tag keys and values are case-sensitive. Tag keys must be unique per resource. If you specify more than one, separate them by commas.",
