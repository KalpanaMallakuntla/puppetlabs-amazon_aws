	"description": "Indicates whether the specified AWS resources are compliant. If a resource is noncompliant, this action returns the number of AWS Config rules that the resource does not comply with. A resource is compliant if it complies with all the AWS Config rules that evaluate it. It is noncompliant if it does not comply with one or more of these rules. If AWS Config has no current evaluation results for the resource, it returns INSUFFICIENT_DATA. This result might indicate one of the following conditions about the rules that evaluate the resource:   AWS Config has never invoked an evaluation for the rule. To check whether it has, use the DescribeConfigRuleEvaluationStatus action to get the LastSuccessfulInvocationTime and LastFailedInvocationTime.   The rule's AWS Lambda function is failing to send evaluation results to AWS Config. Verify that the role that you assigned to your configuration recorder includes the config:PutEvaluations permission. If the rule is a custom rule, verify that the AWS Lambda execution role includes the config:PutEvaluations permission.   The rule's AWS Lambda function has returned NOT_APPLICABLE for all evaluation results. This can occur if the resources were deleted or removed from the rule's scope.  ",
