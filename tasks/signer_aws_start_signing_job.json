Note the following requirements:     You must create an Amazon S3 source bucket. For more information, see Create a Bucket in the Amazon S3 Getting Started Guide.    Your S3 source bucket must be version enabled.   You must create an S3 destination bucket. AWS Signer uses your S3 destination bucket to write your signed code.   You specify the name of the source and destination buckets when calling the StartSigningJob operation.   You must also specify a request token that identifies your request to AWS Signer.    You can call the DescribeSigningJob and the ListSigningJobs actions after you call StartSigningJob. For a Java example that shows how to use this action, see http://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/ ",
