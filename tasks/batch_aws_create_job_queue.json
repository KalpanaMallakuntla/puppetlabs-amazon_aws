	"description": "Creates an AWS Batch job queue. When you create a job queue, you associate one or more compute environments to the queue and assign an order of preference for the compute environments. You also set a priority to the job queue that determines the order in which the AWS Batch scheduler places jobs onto its associated compute environments. For example, if a compute environment is associated with more than one job queue, the job queue with a higher priority is given preference for scheduling jobs to that compute environment.",
