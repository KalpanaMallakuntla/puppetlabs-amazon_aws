	"description": "Retrieves utilization statistics for one or more fleets. You can request utilization data for all fleets, or specify a list of one or more fleet IDs. When requesting multiple fleets, use the pagination parameters to retrieve results as a set of sequential pages. If successful, a FleetUtilization object is returned for each requested fleet ID. When specifying a list of fleet IDs, utilization objects are returned only for fleets that currently exist.   Some API actions may limit the number of fleet IDs allowed in one request. If a request exceeds this limit, the request fails and the error message includes the maximum allowed.   Learn more    Working with Fleets.
