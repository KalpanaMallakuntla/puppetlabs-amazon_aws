	"description": "Creates a listener for the specified Application Load Balancer or Network Load Balancer. To update a listener, use ModifyListener. When you are finished with a listener, you can delete it using DeleteListener. If you are finished with both the listener and the load balancer, you can delete them both using DeleteLoadBalancer. This operation is idempotent, which means that it completes at most one time. If you attempt to create multiple listeners with the same settings, each call succeeds. For more information, see Listeners for Your Application Load Balancers in the Application Load Balancers Guide and Listeners for Your Network Load Balancers in the Network Load Balancers Guide.",
