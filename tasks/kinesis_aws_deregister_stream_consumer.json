You may also provide all three parameters, as long as they don't conflict with each other. If you don't know the name or ARN of the consumer that you want to deregister, you can use the ListStreamConsumers operation to get a list of the descriptions of all the consumers that are currently registered with a given data stream. The description of a consumer contains its name and ARN. This operation has a limit of five transactions per second per account.",
