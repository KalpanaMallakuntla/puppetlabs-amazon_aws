You can update a trail without stopping it first. This action is the only way to stop recording. For a trail enabled in all regions, this operation must be called from the region in which the trail was created, or an InvalidHomeRegionException will occur. This operation cannot be called on the shadow trails (replicated trails in other regions) of a trail enabled in all regions.",
