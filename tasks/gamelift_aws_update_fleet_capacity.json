	"description": "Updates capacity settings for a fleet. Use this action to specify the number of EC2 instances (hosts) that you want this fleet to contain. Before calling this action, you may want to call DescribeEC2InstanceLimits to get the maximum capacity based on the fleet's EC2 instance type. Specify minimum and maximum number of instances. Amazon GameLift will not change fleet capacity to values fall outside of this range. This is particularly important when using auto-scaling (see PutScalingPolicy) to allow capacity to adjust based on player demand while imposing limits on automatic adjustments. To update fleet capacity, specify the fleet ID and the number of instances you want the fleet to host. If successful, Amazon GameLift starts or terminates instances so that the fleet's active instance count matches the desired instance count. You can view a fleet's current capacity information by calling DescribeFleetCapacity. If the desired instance count is higher than the instance type's limit, the 'Limit Exceeded' exception occurs.
