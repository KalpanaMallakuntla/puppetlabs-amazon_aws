You can view a fleet's stopped actions using DescribeFleetAttributes. To stop fleet actions, specify the fleet ID and the type of actions to suspend. When auto-scaling fleet actions are stopped, Amazon GameLift no longer initiates scaling events except to maintain the fleet's desired instances setting (FleetCapacity.
