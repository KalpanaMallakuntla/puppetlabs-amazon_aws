	"description": "Stops a training job. To stop a job, Amazon SageMaker sends the algorithm the SIGTERM signal, which delays job termination for 120 seconds. Algorithms might use this 120-second window to save the model artifacts, so the results of the training is not lost.  Training algorithms provided by Amazon SageMaker save the intermediate results of a model training job. This intermediate data is a valid model artifact. You can use the model artifacts that are saved when Amazon SageMaker stops a training job to create a model.  When it receives a StopTrainingJob request, Amazon SageMaker changes the status of the job to Stopping. After Amazon SageMaker stops the job, it sets the status to Stopped.",
