	"description": "Creates a rule to control sampling behavior for instrumented applications. Services retrieve rules with GetSamplingRules, and evaluate each rule in ascending order of priority for each request. If a rule matches, the service records a trace, borrowing it from the reservoir size. After 10 seconds, the service reports back to X-Ray with GetSamplingTargets to get updated versions of each in-use rule. The updated rule contains a trace quota that the service can use instead of borrowing from the reservoir.",
