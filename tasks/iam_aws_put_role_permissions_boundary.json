	"description": "Adds or updates the policy that is specified as the IAM role's permissions boundary. You can use an AWS managed policy or a customer managed policy to set the boundary for a role. Use the boundary to control the maximum permissions that the role can have. Setting a permissions boundary is an advanced feature that can affect the permissions for the role. You cannot set the boundary for a service-linked role.   Policies used as permissions boundaries do not provide permissions. You must also attach a permissions policy to the role. To learn how the effective permissions for a role are evaluated, see IAM JSON Policy Evaluation Logic in the IAM User Guide.  ",
