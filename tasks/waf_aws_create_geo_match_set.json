	"description": "Creates an GeoMatchSet, which you use to specify which web requests you want to allow or block based on the country that the requests originate from. For example, if you're receiving a lot of requests from one or more countries and you want to block the requests, you can create an GeoMatchSet that contains those countries and then configure AWS WAF to block the requests.  To create and configure a GeoMatchSet, perform the following steps:   Use GetChangeToken to get the change token that you provide in the ChangeToken parameter of a CreateGeoMatchSet request.   Submit a CreateGeoMatchSet request.   Use GetChangeToken to get the change token that you provide in the ChangeToken parameter of an UpdateGeoMatchSet request.   Submit an UpdateGeoMatchSetSet request to specify the countries that you want AWS WAF to watch for.   For more information about how to use the AWS WAF API to allow or block HTTP requests, see the AWS WAF Developer Guide.",
