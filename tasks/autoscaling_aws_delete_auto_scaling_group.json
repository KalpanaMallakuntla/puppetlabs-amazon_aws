	"description": "Deletes the specified Auto Scaling group. If the group has instances or scaling activities in progress, you must specify the option to force the deletion in order for it to succeed. If the group has policies, deleting the group deletes the policies, the underlying alarm actions, and any alarm that no longer has an associated action. To remove instances from the Auto Scaling group before deleting it, call DetachInstances with the list of instances and the option to decrement the desired capacity so that Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling does not launch replacement instances. To terminate all instances before deleting the Auto Scaling group, call UpdateAutoScalingGroup and set the minimum size and desired capacity of the Auto Scaling group to zero.",
