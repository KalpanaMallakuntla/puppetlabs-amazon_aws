	"description": " Creates a new AWS secret access key and corresponding AWS access key ID for the specified user. The default status for new keys is Active. If you do not specify a user name, IAM determines the user name implicitly based on the AWS access key ID signing the request. This operation works for access keys under the AWS account. Consequently, you can use this operation to manage AWS account root user credentials. This is true even if the AWS account has no associated users.  For information about limits on the number of keys you can create, see Limitations on IAM Entities in the IAM User Guide.  To ensure the security of your AWS account, the secret access key is accessible only during key and user creation. You must save the key (for example, in a text file) if you want to be able to access it again. If a secret key is lost, you can delete the access keys for the associated user and then create new keys. ",
