Use an Action element to allow or deny permission to call this action.   Constrain the following parameters by using a Condition element with the appropriate keys.    workflowType.name: String constraint. The key is swf:workflowType.name.    workflowType.version: String constraint. The key is swf:workflowType.version.     If the caller doesn't have sufficient permissions to invoke the action, or the parameter values fall outside the specified constraints, the action fails. The associated event attribute's cause parameter is set to OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED. For details and example IAM policies, see Using IAM to Manage Access to Amazon SWF Workflows in the Amazon SWF Developer Guide.",
