	"description": "Enables server-side encryption (SSE) for the delivery stream. This operation is asynchronous. It returns immediately. When you invoke it, Kinesis Firehose first sets the status of the stream to ENABLING then to ENABLED. You can continue to read and write data to your stream while its status is ENABLING but they won't get encrypted. It can take up to 5 seconds after the encryption status changes to ENABLED before all records written to the delivery stream are encrypted. To check the encryption state of a delivery stream, use DescribeDeliveryStream.  You can only enable SSE for a delivery stream that uses DirectPut as its source.  The StartDeliveryStreamEncryption and StopDeliveryStreamEncryption operations have a combined limit of 25 calls per delivery stream per 24 hours. For example, you reach the limit if you call StartDeliveryStreamEncryption thirteen times and StopDeliveryStreamEncryption twelve times for the same stream in a 24-hour period.",
