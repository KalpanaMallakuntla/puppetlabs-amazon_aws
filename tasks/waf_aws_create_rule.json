	"description": "Creates a Rule, which contains the IPSet objects, ByteMatchSet objects, and other predicates that identify the requests that you want to block. If you add more than one predicate to a Rule, a request must match all of the specifications to be allowed or blocked. For example, suppose you add the following to a Rule:   An IPSet that matches the IP address 192.0.2.44/32    A ByteMatchSet that matches BadBot in the User-Agent header   You then add the Rule to a WebACL and specify that you want to blocks requests that satisfy the Rule. For a request to be blocked, it must come from the IP address 192.0.2.44 and the User-Agent header in the request must contain the value BadBot. To create and configure a Rule, perform the following steps:   Create and update the predicates that you want to include in the Rule. For more information, see CreateByteMatchSet, CreateIPSet, and CreateSqlInjectionMatchSet.   Use GetChangeToken to get the change token that you provide in the ChangeToken parameter of a CreateRule request.   Submit a CreateRule request.   Use GetChangeToken to get the change token that you provide in the ChangeToken parameter of an UpdateRule request.   Submit an UpdateRule request to specify the predicates that you want to include in the Rule.   Create and update a WebACL that contains the Rule. For more information, see CreateWebACL.   For more information about how to use the AWS WAF API to allow or block HTTP requests, see the AWS WAF Developer Guide.",
