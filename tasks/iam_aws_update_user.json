For more information, see Renaming an IAM User and Renaming an IAM Group in the IAM User Guide.    To change a user name, the requester must have appropriate permissions on both the source object and the target object. For example, to change Bob to Robert, the entity making the request must have permission on Bob and Robert, or must have permission on all (*).
