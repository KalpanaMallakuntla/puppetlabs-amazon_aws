	"description": "Initiates a snapshot of a gateway from a volume recovery point. This operation is only supported in the cached volume gateway type. A volume recovery point is a point in time at which all data of the volume is consistent and from which you can create a snapshot. To get a list of volume recovery point for cached volume gateway, use ListVolumeRecoveryPoints. In the CreateSnapshotFromVolumeRecoveryPoint request, you identify the volume by providing its Amazon Resource Name (ARN). You must also provide a description for the snapshot. When the gateway takes a snapshot of the specified volume, the snapshot and its description appear in the AWS Storage Gateway console. In response, the gateway returns you a snapshot ID. You can use this snapshot ID to check the snapshot progress or later use it when you want to create a volume from a snapshot.  To list or delete a snapshot, you must use the Amazon EC2 API. For more information, in Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud API Reference. ",
