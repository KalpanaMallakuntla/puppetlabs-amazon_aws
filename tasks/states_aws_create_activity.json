Activities must poll Step Functions using the GetActivityTask API action and respond using SendTask* API actions. This function lets Step Functions know the existence of your activity and returns an identifier for use in a state machine and when polling from the activity.  This operation is eventually consistent. The results are best effort and may not reflect very recent updates and changes. ",
