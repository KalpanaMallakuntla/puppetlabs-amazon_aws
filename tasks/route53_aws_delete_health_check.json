If you delete a health check and you don't update the associated resource record sets, the future status of the health check can't be predicted and may change. This will affect the routing of DNS queries for your DNS failover configuration. For more information, see Replacing and Deleting Health Checks in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide. ",
